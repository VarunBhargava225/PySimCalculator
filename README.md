# PySimCalculator
# Here I made a Simple Calculator using tkinter in Python.
# takes two number from user as input
# Performs action (+, *, -, /) according to user choice
# Shows result at the top left of the window

# Window.mainloop() tells Python to run the Tkinter event loop
# This method listens for events, such as button clicks or keypresses,
# & blocks any code that comes after it from running until the window it's called on is closed.
